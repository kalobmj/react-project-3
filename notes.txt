study.io (start with a simple tool for you then expand)

think of a social media platform first, study utility 2nd.

can see if others are online and what are they studying, working on, also away / afk similar to discord

make mock users to fill leaderboard

tool or app u need

simple todo list

can make into a react native app

possibly have section for study timer?

(kanban board inspired)
3 sections, to do, in progress, done. (after a day or two the done goes away / can possibly keep info and have a list that can be toggled)

** colors **
blue - react blue (todo)
yellow - light yellow (in progress)
green - bright green (copy others green) (done)

light and dark mode

items are draggable from one section to another

can possibly set up sections for user to save their data and have unique logins, auth

if want extra : user be able to make own profile, with completed assignments done / todo / need to do etc...

profile can have classes being taken / major

point system when completing projects, use points to buy things? or just leave leaderboard for points

on profile copy github style tracker

simplistic layout similar to monkeytype

create creative logo with animations

possible animations for moving items (special animation / sound for completing items)

should be able to work on mobile (screen widths)

need to flesh out how props work with our components

need to get columns and items working (maybe just make placeholder for one col and col with items to start)

items will fall into correct section and change their status depending on where they are dropped

use bootstrap for items :
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/list-group/#active-items

need to fix sortable js list in bookmarks

plan is to have each column, then have various placeholder tasks in each (choose from list of placeholder)
